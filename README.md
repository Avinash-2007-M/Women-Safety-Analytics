Women Safety Analytics -Protecting Women from Threats to Their Safety

Abstract:
Women's safety remains a major concern due to the increasing number of crimes against women in public spaces. Many incidents occur due to the absence of real-time monitoring and lack of proactive intervention. Traditional surveillance systems are reactive, meaning they only record events rather than actively detecting and preventing threats. This results in delayed responses from authorities, increasing the risk of harm.

 

Problem Identification:
Women often face safety threats in public spaces due to the lack of surveillance, slow response times, and an absence of real-time threat detection. Traditional systems only record incidents without proactively preventing them, leading to delayed interventions and higher crime rates. 



Proposed Solution:
To address this issue, an advanced Women Safety Analytics system is proposed. This solution uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision to continuously monitor public areas, analyse real-time data, and detect potential threats. The system generates alerts for law enforcement or emergency responders when unusual activities are detected. 

Solution Implementation:
The Women Safety Analytics system includes the following key functionalities: 
1. Person Detection & Gender Classification - Detects individuals and classifies their gender.
2. Gender Distribution Analysis - Tracks the male-to-female ratio in a location.
3. Detection of a Lone Woman at Night - Identifies a woman alone in an unsafe environment and triggers alerts.
 4. Detection of a Woman Surrounded by Men - Recognizes high-risk situations and sends alerts. 
5. Recognizing SOS Situations Through Gesture Analytics - Detects distress signals for immediate response.
 6. Identifying Crime Hotspots - Uses past alert data to identify high-risk locations. 



Advantages of the System:
* Real-time Monitoring & Alerts: Immediate response to potential threats. 
* Proactive Security Measures: Reduces the risk of incidents. 
* Enhanced Law Enforcement Support: Enables police intervention before escalation. 
* Data-Driven Safety Planning: Identifies high-risk areas for improved policies.
* Increased Public Confidence: Encourages safer public spaces for women.
